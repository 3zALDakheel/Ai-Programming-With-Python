1.Question 
Did the three model architectures classify the breed of 
dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not
, report the differences in the classifications.


1.Answer

vgg model:yes

resnet model:yes

alexnet model:no

2.Question
Did each of the three model architectures classify the
breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog
as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not
, report the differences in the classifications.


2.Answer

vgg model:no the classfier labeled the dog_02 image as toy (terrier) wich is very strange

resnet model:no the classifier labeld the dog_02 image as (basenji) which is a bit similar

alexnet model:no the classifier labeld the dog_02 image as (basenji) which is a bit similar

Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be 
dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.


3.Answer

vgg model:yes

resnet model:yes

alexnet model:yes

3.Question
Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, 
select the model architecture that you feel did the 
best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe 
why you selected that model architecture as the best 
on uploaded image classification.

as for me i feel VGG is the best model
because the model 
matches the dog_01, object and the animal
and was the best model in the 40 image test

but for the fastest model in the 40 images test

AlexNet was the fastest with 0:0:3 sec
followed by ResNet with 	 0:0:5 sec
and VGG was the slowest  with 0:0:35 sec
